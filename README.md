I write about software over on Substack, at [Software and Synapses](https://softwareandsynapses.substack.com/).

## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

## About me
I build stuff, and I have a lot of fun doing it. You can learn more on [my website](https://www.aidantilgner.dev/projects) if you want. Some recent things I've built are:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Project Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Site</th>
    <th>Repository Link</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Simple Agent</td>
    <td>A simple agent powered by LLMs that performs tasks.</td>
    <td>n/a</td>
    <td><a href="https://github.com/AidanTilgner/Simple-Agent">repo</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Simple Vector Store</td>
    <td>A simple python tool which leverages [sqlite-vss](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vss) and allows you to vectorize directories and perform queries.</td>
    <td>n/a</td>
    <td><a href="https://github.com/AidanTilgner/Simple-Vector-Store">repo</a></td>

  </tr>
</table>


Lately I've been more interested in open source, and making software that other people can build on top of. Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Project Name</th>
      <th>Owner</th>
      <th>Role</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Repository Link</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Assistant Framework</td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/QuasarBrains">QuasarBrains</a></td>
      <td>Maintainer</td>
      <td>An extensible framework for building out digital assistants based on large language models</td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/QuasarBrains/Assistant">repo</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>JuniorGPT</td>
      <td>Just me</td>
      <td>Maintainer</td>
      <td>An (WIP) autonomous software developer which is designed to be about as capable as a junior developer</td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/QuasarBrains/Developer">repo</a></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
