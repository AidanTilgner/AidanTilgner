I write about software over on Substack, at [Software and Synapses](https://softwareandsynapses.substack.com/).

## Me I guess
I build stuff, and I have a lot of fun doing it. You can learn more on [my website](https://www.aidantilgner.dev/projects) if you want. Some recent things I've built are:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Project Name</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Site</th>
    <th>Repository Link</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>AIrtisan</td>
    <td>Build chatbots with query understanding + ChatGPT fallback</td>
    <td><a href="https://airtisan.app/">site</a></td>

  </tr>

Lately I've been more interested in open source, and making software that other people can build on top of. Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Project Name</th>
      <th>Owner</th>
      <th>Role</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Repository Link</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Assistant Framework</td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/QuasarBrains">QuasarBrains</a></td>
      <td>Maintainer</td>
      <td>An extensible framework for building out digital assistants based on large language models</td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/QuasarBrains/Assistant">repo</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Flowise</td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/FlowiseAI">FlowiseAI</a></td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>JuniorGPT</td>
      <td>Just me</td>
      <td>Maintainer</td>
      <td>An autonomous software developer which is designed to be about as capable as a junior developer</td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/QuasarBrains/Developer">repo</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Experiments and Research</td>
      <td>Just me</td>
      <td>Maintainer</td>
      <td>Some experiments and research that I've done or collected which help me understand things or build better things</td>
      <td><a href="https://github.com/AidanTilgner/Experiments-and-Research">repo</a></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
